# CS210-Project1
In this project, we were instructed to create a 12-hour and a 24-hour clock at the same time. The project was challenging, especially when figuring out how to convert between the two time formats, but I was able to solve it through careful testing. I think it was even more challenging because this was in week 3 and C++ is not easy.
